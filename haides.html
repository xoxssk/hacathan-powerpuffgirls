    <fieldset>     HOPP Summer Student Program 

<br>
      The HOPP Summer Student Program provides high school students with hands-on experience in laboratory techniques. Students conduct independent research projects and attend enriching training sessions and tours designed to support their interest in the clinical side of translational research and fuel their curiosity for science.
      Applications for 2024 HOPP Summer Student Program will open December 4, 2023.

      High School Summer Internship Program 
      This program is for 11th and 12th graders interested in exploring careers in research and healthcare. With the exception of the HiSTEP program, these are full-time research positions within one of the NIH Institutes and Centers (IC) in the NIH Intramural Research Program. Research groups are located on all NIH campuses, including the main campus in Bethesda, MD.
      High school summer interns are selected by a central committee in each Institute/Center and placed in a research group to work under the supervision of a Principal Investigator (PI). HS-SIP applicants should not contact NIH investigators directly to explore possible positions.
      We offer research opportunities in biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences with opportunities to explore basic, translational, and clinical research. Students interested in biology, engineering, epidemiology, psychology, mathematics, chemistry, pharmaceutical sciences, nursing, physics, computer science, bioinformatics, and other health-related fields are invited to apply. Summer interns may not work in administrative offices or outside of the NIH IRP.

      NYC Commuter Summer
<br>
      The commuter option is open to students entering grades 9–12 and freshman year of college. Students who choose to live off-campus can still enjoy most campus resources, including special events, activities and commuter-specific lounges. Students will choose from over 70 courses in a dozen subject areas, spending about four hours in class every weekday with a two-hour midday break. Classes are taught by expert instructors who will challenge students to think independently, critically, and creatively, with both open-mindedness and precision.
      Upon successful completion, students will earn a Columbia University Certification of Participation and evaluations written by their instructors to further set them apart in the college application process.
