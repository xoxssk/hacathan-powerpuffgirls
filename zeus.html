  <fieldset> New York Presbyterian Volunteer
    <br>
<br>
    NewYork-Presbyterian volunteers are warm and caring individuals who give back to their community. Volunteers offer their time, talent and dedication throughout the hospital in patient care and clerical settings providing an extra dimension of services to our patients and families. Volunteers are a vital part of NewYork-Presbyterian with more than 2,300 volunteers each year currently serving across our eleven locations. Our volunteers come from unique backgrounds but are commonly interested in helping others. The attention they provide is invaluable to patients, families and staff.
  </br>
    <br>
    Volunteers are asked to give a minimum of four hours per week for a minimum of 150 hours during 6 months of service. There are a variety of volunteer roles to fit individual time schedules, abilities, and interests. Volunteers may be assigned directly with patients or choose an assignment behind-the-scenes in clerical positions throughout the hospital.

    VolunteerMatch is the most effective way to recruit highly qualified volunteers for your nonprofit. We match you with people who are passionate about and committed to your cause, and who can help when and where you need them.

    And because volunteers are often donors as well, we make it easy for them to contribute their time and money.
